            <h3> Calculator </h3>
            <p> This calculator is written in Java as an attempt to recreate 
            the Windows calculator. This was my first experience in coding 
            a graphical user interface (GUI) in Java using the Java Abstract 
            Window Toolkit. The program currently still has bugs but is able 
            to perform simple operations. </p>

            <h3> BeLive </h3>
            <p> This application is a big project that is still in the works but 
            was invented with the hope that it will make life easier for those who 
            are less fortunate to have the tools that we do today in our society. 
            This application  provides the medical attention for people who are in 
            areas with no doctors or lack of trust in the medical system in their society. 
            Therefore this application will act as a doctor or help guide the patient 
            on a path to curing or temporarily easing pain in the area of need. This will be 
            done through a database storing medical information relevant to the geographical 
            location where the person is. The program prompts for their name and other 
            revelant information, if they would like to provide it, and then asks them to 
            select the area on the body where the pain is and then provide an explanation 
            of what the issue is and symptoms. From this information the application will 
            searching through the database, which is stored locally in the application. Then
            the application will list a table of multiple treatments that the user can find 
            in their area. If the user chooses to double click on the treatments shown in the 
            table more information regarding how to apply the treament in detail will be provided. 
            Many other features are yet to be added but the current design runs as a template with 
            dummy information. This application was written in Java.</p>

        <!--An emergency feature is yet to be added along with a image capturing part that 
        allow the user to take a photo of their injury and it will be sent to doctors 
        to diagnose and attempt to solve.-->

            <h3> Clippy's Revenge </h3>
            <p> This is a project that I worked on along side two very good
            video game designers in the Imangi Global Game Jam 2021. In this
            Global Game Jam we were given 48 hours to develop a game based on 
            the theme of Lost & Found. They created most of the game and I 
            attempted to create the task that I was given but as this was a
            timed event my addition was not able to be added in time due to
            compatability issues. This Game Jam taught me a lot about C#
            and the game development application Unity. </p>
