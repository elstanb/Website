            <h4> Calculator </h4>
            <p> This calculator is written in Java as an attempt to recreate 
            the Windows calculator. This was my first experience in coding 
            a graphical user interface (GUI) in Java using the Java Abstract 
            Window Toolkit. The program currently still has bugs but is able 
            to perform simple operations. </p>

            <h4> BeLive </h4>
            <p> This application is a big project that is still in the works but 
            was invented with the hope that it will make life easier for those who 
            are less fortunate to have the tools that we do today in our society. 
            This application  provides the medical attention for people who are in 
            areas with no doctors or lack of trust in the medical system in their society. 
            Therefore this application will act as a doctor or help guide the patient 
            on a path to curing or temporarily easing pain in the area of need. This is 
            done through a database storing medical information relevant to the geographical 
            location where the person is and all know medical information. The program prompts 
            for their name and other revelant information if they would like to provide it 
            and then asks them to select the area on the body where the pain is and then 
            provide an explanation of what the issue is and how they feel. This will result 
            in the application searching through the database, which is stored locally in 
            in the application, based on keywords in the description provided by the user. 
            Then the application will list multiple treatments that the user can find and 
            gain access of within their area and therefore treat the injury momentarily. 
            An emergency feature is yet to be added along with a image capturing part that 
            allow the user to take a photo of their injury and it will be sent to doctors 
            to diagnose and attempt to solve. </p>

            <h4> Clippy's Revenge </h4>
            <p> This is a project that I worked on along side two very good
            video game designers in the Imangi Global Game Jam 2021. In this
            Global Game Jam we were given 48 hours to develop a game based on 
            the theme of Lost & Found. They created most of the game and I 
            attempted to create the task that I was given but as this was a
            timed event my addition was not able to be added in time due to
            compatability issues. This Game Jam taught me a lot about C#
            and the game development application Unity. </p>
