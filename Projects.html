                This calculator is an attempt to recreate 
                the Windows calculator. This was my first experience in coding 
                a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Java Abstract 
                Window Toolkit. The program currently still has bugs but is able 
                to perform simple operations. </p>

                This application is a big project that is still in the works but 
                was invented with the hope that it will make life easier for those who 
                are less fortunate to have the tools that we do today in our society. 
                This application  provides the medical attention for people who are in 
                areas with no doctors or lack of trust in the medical system in their society. 
                Therefore this application will act as a doctor or help guide the patient 
                on a path to curing or temporarily easing pain in the area of need. This will be 
                done through a database storing medical information relevant to the geographical 
                location where the person is. The program prompts for their name and other 
                revelant information, if they would like to provide it, and then asks them to 
                select the area on the body where the pain is and then provide an explanation 
                of what the issue is and symptoms. From this information the application will 
                searching through the database, which is stored locally in the application. Then
                the application will list a table of multiple treatments that the user can find 
                in their area. If the user chooses to double click on the treatments shown in the 
                table more information regarding how to apply the treament in detail will be provided. 
                Many other features are yet to be added but the current design runs as a template with 
                dummy information.</p>

                This is a project that I worked on along side two very good
                video game designers in the Imangi Global Game Jam 2021. In this
                Global Game Jam we were given 48 hours to develop a game based on 
                the theme of Lost & Found. They created most of the game and I 
                attempted to create the task that I was given but as this was a
                timed event my addition was not able to be added in time due to
                compatability issues. This Game Jam taught me a lot about C#
                and the game development application Unity. </p>

                This is a project that I worked on along side five other
                computer science students. We introduced a new billing
                functionality to the iTrust2 Medical Recording System. I
                worked specifically on the front-end creating the view bills
                page for both the patient and the billing staff member. I also
                helped to fix issues with the backend API and SQL database. 
                Through this project I learned how to work togethe rwith a large 
                group of computer scientists and furthered my knowledge with 
                AngularJS and SQL. </p>

                This is a project that I worked on along side four other
                computer science students. We expanded upon the current cybersecurity
                tools that the Truist cybersecurity team was using in there XSOAR common
                platform. In this project I worked on a subteam for a specific cybersecurity
                tool that Truist wanted integrated to there system which was DMTF Redfish.
                This tool needed to be integrated to the system with specific functionality
                defined by our sponsor with Truist. The functionalities that they wanted
                were specific to account management in there system: reset user password, 
                revoke privilege, and list all users on the system. This functionality
                was created and properly integrated into the XSOAR system and will be 
                incorporated into the open source community.</p>
